# coolify-apps

Welcome to **`coolify-apps`**, a repository of Docker Compose files for applications I personally self-host through [Coolify](https://coolify.io).

## ðŸ¤” Motivation

Although most self-hostable applications are easy to deploy (especially with the bundled [one-click services](https://coolify.io/docs/services/overview)) â€” I constantly find myself having to go through multiple, extra steps to be able to customize these deployments so it's applicable for my personal use case.

This involves...

- having to read through more documentation
- setting specific environment variables
- running ad-hoc scripts
- orchestrating additional containers/services
- _etc., etc._

Hence, this repository aims to take all the above customizations, and "document" it in replicable `docker-compose.yml` files â€” so the next time I need to make any of these deployments, I'm able to do it in a standardized and automated manner.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The repository is structured like so:

```
coolify-apps/
â”œâ”€â”€ [[ App Directory ]]/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs.md
â”œâ”€â”€ docs.example.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Each **App Directory** contains exactly two files â€”

- `docker-compose.yml` - The Docker Compose file to be used in Coolify.
- `docs.md` - Outlines the customizations made in the Docker Compose file.

The `docs.example.md` file is a template for how each App Directory's `docs.md` file is to be structured and formatted.
