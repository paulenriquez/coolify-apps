# coolify-apps

Welcome to **`coolify-apps`**, a repository of Docker Compose files for applications I personally self-host through [Coolify](https://coolify.io).

## ü§î Motivation

Although most self-hostable applications are easy to deploy (especially with the bundled [one-click services](https://coolify.io/docs/services/overview)) ‚Äî I constantly find myself having to go through multiple, extra steps to be able to customize these deployments so it's applicable for my personal use case.

This involves...

- having to read through more documentation
- setting specific environment variables
- running ad-hoc scripts
- orchestrating additional containers/services
- _etc., etc._

Hence, this repository aims to take all the above customizations, and "document" it in replicable `docker-compose.yaml` files ‚Äî so the next time I need to make any of these deployments, I'm able to do it in a standardized and automated manner.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process

The process I follow for each application is...

1. Find a **"Starting Point"** ‚Äî a pre-made Docker Compose file, maybe from the application's official repository.

2. Customize the "Starting Point" based on my use-case. This will become the `docker-compose.yaml` file you'll find in each application directory within this repository.

3. Document the customizations I made in #2. This will be come the `DOCS.md` file you'll find in each application directory as well.

## üìÇ Structure

The repository is structured like so:

```
coolify-apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [[ App Directory ]]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DOCS.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DOCS.example.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

Each **App Directory** contains exactly two files ‚Äî

- `docker-compose.yaml` - The Custom Docker Compose file of the application to be deployed to Coolify.
- `DOCS.md` - Documents the customizations present in each application's Docker Compose file.

The `DOCS.example.md` file is a template for how each App Directory's `DOCS.md` file is to be structured and formatted.
