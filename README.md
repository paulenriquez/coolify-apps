# coolify-apps

Welcome to **`coolify-apps`**, a repository of Docker Compose files for applications I personally self-host through [Coolify](https://coolify.io).

## ü§î Motivation

Although most self-hostable applications are easy to deploy (especially with the bundled [one-click services](https://coolify.io/docs/services/overview)) ‚Äî I constantly find myself having to go through multiple, extra steps to be able to customize these deployments so it's applicable for my personal use case.

This involves...

- having to read through more documentation
- setting specific environment variables
- running ad-hoc scripts
- orchestrating additional containers/services
- _etc., etc._

Hence, this repository aims to take all the above customizations, and "document" it in replicable `docker-compose.yaml` files ‚Äî so the next time I need to make any of these deployments, I'm able to do it in a standardized and automated manner.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process

The process I follow for each application is...

1. Find a **"Starting Point"** ‚Äî a pre-made Docker Compose file, maybe from the application's official repository.

2. Customize the "Starting Point" based on my use-case. This will become the `docker-compose.yaml` file you'll find in each application directory within this repository.

3. Document the customizations I made in #2. This will become the `DOCS.md` file you'll find in each application directory as well.

## üìÇ Structure

The repository is structured like so:

```
coolify-apps/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ [[ App Directory ]]/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DOCS.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DOCS.example.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

Each **App Directory** contains exactly two files ‚Äî

- `docker-compose.yaml` - The Custom Docker Compose file of the application to be deployed to Coolify.
- `DOCS.md` - Documents the customizations present in each application's Docker Compose file.

The `DOCS.example.md` file is a template for how each App Directory's `DOCS.md` file is to be structured and formatted.

## üöÄ Applications

| Application               |                         Custom Docker Compose                          |                 Customizations                 |
| ------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
| Logto                     |           [docker-compose.yaml](./logto/docker-compose.yaml)           |           [DOCS.md](./logto/DOCS.md)           |
| MorbZ/docker-web-redirect | [docker-compose.yaml](./morbz-docker-web-redirect/docker-compose.yaml) | [DOCS.md](./morbz-docker-web-redirect/DOCS.md) |
| Open WebUI                |        [docker-compose.yaml](./open-webui/docker-compose.yaml)         |        [DOCS.md](./open-webui/DOCS.md)         |

## üîó Localhost Port Mappings

Some of the applications are configured to bind directly to `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`).

These are typically admin panels or internal UIs that aren't intended to be exposed to the public internet. Instead, they are to be accessed through SSH Local Port Forwarding.

To prevent port conflicts ‚Äî these containers are configured to run on port series 2XXXX.

The list below keeps track of all containers configured to directly bind with `localhost`, as well as the associated port:

| Application                                    |  Service  |  Port   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | :-------: | :-----: |
| [open-webui](./open-webui/docker-compose.yaml) | `docling` | `25001` |
