# Open WebUI

A user-friendly, open-source web UI for LLMs.

- **Official Website:** https://openwebui.com/

- **Starting Point:** [Docker Compose File from Open WebUI's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml) (_as of 27-May-2025_)

### No Ollama

This setup does not include Ollama, as Open WebUI will be used as a front-end to connect to external model APIs.

### Customized Authentication

**For OIDC** â€” included the ff. environment variables:

1. `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - OIDC client ID
2. `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - OIDC client secret
3. `OPENID_PROVIDER_URL` - OIDC well known URL, for example https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
4. `OAUTH_SCOPES` - Scopes to request. Defaults to openid email profile

Additionally, the following were also included:

```yaml
ENABLE_SIGNUP=false
ENABLE_OAUTH_SIGNUP=false
```

### Added Docker Volume Backup

Included `offen/docker-volume-backup` service to regularly backup the SQLite database used by Open WebUI. Configured to upload backups to an S3-compatible storage bucket. The following environment variables need to be set in Coolify: `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `S3_BUCKET`. The number of days to keep backups can be configured using the `BACKUP_KEEP_DAYS` environment variable (defaults to 7 days). The backup runs daily at midnight (0 0 \* \* \*), but can be customized using the `BACKUP_CRON_SCHEDULE` environment variable. For more details, refer to the [offen/docker-volume-backup documentation](https://offen.github.io/docker-volume-backup/).

### Removed `ports` from the compose file

Prevents Open WebUI from being accessible at `<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:<OPEN_WEBUI_PORT>`.
